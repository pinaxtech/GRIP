This repo consists of the task alloted to me during internship in Computer Vision and IoT
In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values.

The project file contains 3 important files -
[1]-Color detection.ipynb — main source code of our project.
[2]-color palette.jpg — sample image for experimenting.
[3]-Colors.csv — a file that contains our data set.
